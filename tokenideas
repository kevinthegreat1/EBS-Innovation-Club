POSSIBLE WAYS TO USE THE TOKENS WE HAVE ALREADY:

proof of donation coin or nft - anyone who donates more than $x may claim their token
earth day coin - for use in events related to earth day (and this could roll over into country fair, winter carnival, etc)
conservation coin - a pool of tokens used to keep score of which groups (dorms?  advisories? classes?) are able to do the most conserving of resources in ways that are measurable and not easy to fake.
diploma nft - proof of graduation, issued to each graduate if they want it
teacher coin - name a token each year after whomever is chosen for the yearbook dedication 
fundraising nfts - auctioned at family weekends or the 100th reunion online?
  * one to rule them all - the golden eagle
  * nfts made of student art in the annual magazines
  * nfts of each dorm and school building
  * a group of tokens / nfts matching the giving levels: rock society, gold eagle, etc.
  * a group of tokens / nfts for each class / student that gives ANY amount in that year?
  * more...
what else can we come up with?
