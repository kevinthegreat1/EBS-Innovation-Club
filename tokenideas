POSSIBLE WAYS TO USE THE TOKENS WE HAVE ALREADY:

proof of donation coin or nft - anyone who donates more than $x may claim their token
earth day coin - for use in events related to earth day (and this could roll over into country fair, winter carnival, etc)
conservation coin - a pool of tokens used to keep score of which groups (dorms?  advisories? classes?) are able to do the most conserving of resources in ways that are measurable and not easy to fake.
diploma nft - proof of graduation, issued to each graduate if they want it
teacher coin - name a token each year after whomever is chosen for the yearbook dedication 
what else can we come up with?
